MMORPGClasses [Classes]

Discord: https://discord.gg/4cV7Tu7ESu

MMORPGClasses is a plugin with zero dependencies. The only exception to this is PlaceholderAPI, which is a soft dependency.
The plugin will work with or without PlaceholderAPI, it's only required if you want to use the placeholders within the plugin.

In order to use and run MMORPGClasses you must download the .jar file from SpigotMC. After, stop your server and place the .jar
file into the plugins folder (your server/plugins). After, start your server up and let the files generate. All plugin storage is
stored in yaml files for ease of access for everyone. The plugin can be used by ill-experienced owners/developers or highly
experienced owners/developers.

If you have questions or concerns, please use the discord server. The reviews section of the SpigotMC page is not the place for support
and all support requests/questions in the reviews will be ignored. Further, when you join the discord server you must use the correct
channels when asking for support or making a suggestion otherwise they will be ignored.
